Balatro Patcher(y)

patchy, a tool I wrote to facilitate modding Balatro in linux 
(since you can just do what this does in windows).

It's not perfect, just like every repo of mine, but it does the job.
The usage and compilation are easy enough, I will include prebuilt binaries
on the releases page, but since this isn't a BIG project, unless the entire
Balatro folder structure changes, I won't be updating this too much.

If you want to compile it by yourself, you'll need my library clicky (https://github.com/auth-xyz/clicky)
After making sure clicky is installed, all you have to run is `make`.
That's it!

If you have any questions, comments, or concerns, please open an issue on the repo.
(or suggestions)

Have fun modding!
